# 🌍 DenseNet for Land Type Classification

This project applies a DenseNet-based Convolutional Neural Network to classify different types of land usage from satellite imagery. It leverages the RGB version of the EuroSAT dataset and is built using TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🛰️ Project Goals

- Automate classification of land use types using satellite images.
- Build a deep learning model based on DenseNet architecture.
- Analyze performance metrics to evaluate real-world applicability.

## 🧠 Model

- **Architecture**: DenseNet121
- **Input**: RGB Satellite Images (64x64)
- **Output**: Land type labels (e.g., Forest, Urban, Agricultural)
- **Training**: Optimized with Adam, using Data Augmentation.


## 🔧 Technologies Used
